            <h2>Breaking News!</h2>
            <p>In a shocking turn of events, RITchie, the beloved mascot of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), was kidnapped by a group of rogue students from the University of Rochester. The plot, spearheaded by the infamous YellowJacket, was hatched with a singular, sinister motive: to diminish the indomitable spirit of the Tigers.</p>
            <p>The University of Rochester, known for their fierce rivalry with RIT, orchestrated the kidnapping in an attempt to demoralize the student body and secure victory in the upcoming intercollegiate competitions. They believed that without their spirited mascot, RIT’s teams and supporters would falter.</p>
            <p>But little did they know, the true spirit of RIT lies not in a mascot but in the hearts and minds of its students, faculty, and community.</p>
