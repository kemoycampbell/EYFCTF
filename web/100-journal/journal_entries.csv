June 10th,Today was a good day in the jungle. I found a new watering hole near the big oak tree. The water is so clear and refreshing. I even caught a few fish to snack on. Life as a tiger is pretty great sometimes.
June 12th,"The weather has been hot lately, so I’ve been spending a lot of time lounging in the shade. I found a perfect spot under a large rock where the breeze keeps me cool. It’s my new favorite place to relax."
June 15th,I met a new friend today! A young tiger named Tara. She’s playful and full of energy. We spent the afternoon chasing butterflies and playing in the tall grass. It’s nice to have a friend around.
June 20th,"I’ve been thinking a lot about exploring new territories. The jungle is wonderful, but I feel the call of adventure. I’ve heard tales of a place called Croatia, with beautiful landscapes and plenty of prey. Maybe it’s time for a change."
June 22nd,"I had a strange encounter today. A group of humans passed by my favorite hunting grounds. They were carrying strange devices and talking in hushed tones. I stayed hidden, but I couldn’t help but feel curious. What could they be up to?"
June 25th,"Today, I caught the biggest deer I’ve ever seen! It was a tough hunt, but the reward was worth it. I shared the feast with Tara and a few other tigers. We had a great time celebrating our successful hunt."
June 28th,"The urge to travel is growing stronger. I’ve started planning a route towards Croatia. It’s a long journey, but I’m excited about the possibilities. I’ve marked a few key locations along the way for rest and hunting."
July 1st,"I’ve decided to leave tomorrow. I’ve gathered enough food for the journey and said my goodbyes to Tara and the others. I’m a bit nervous, but also thrilled about what lies ahead. Croatia, here I come!"
July 3rd,"The first leg of my journey went smoothly. I traveled through dense F0r3sts and open plains, always keeping an eye out for danger. I’ve made good progress and found a nice cave to rest in for the night."
July 5th,Something feels off. I noticed strange markings on the trees and heard unusual noises at night. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being followed. I need to stay alert and be cautious. My journey to Cr0at1a might be more dangerous than I anticipated.
