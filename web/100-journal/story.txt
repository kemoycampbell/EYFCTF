Today was a good day in the jungle. I found a new watering hole near the big oak tree. The water is so clear and refreshing. I even caught a few fish to snack on. Life as a tiger is pretty great sometimes.

The weather has been hot lately, so I’ve been spending a lot of time lounging in the shade. I found a perfect spot under a large rock where the breeze keeps me cool. It’s my new favorite place to relax.

I had a strange encounter today. A group of humans passed by my favorite hunting grounds. They were carrying strange devices and talking in hushed tones. I stayed hidden, but I couldn’t help but feel curious. What could they be up to?

The urge to travel is growing stronger. I’ve started planning a route towards Croatia. It’s a long journey, but I’m excited about the possibilities. I’ve marked a few key locations along the way for rest and hunting.

### Diary Entry 8: July 1st
I’ve decided to leave tomorrow. I’ve gathered enough food for the journey and said my goodbyes to Tara and the others. I’m a bit nervous, but also thrilled about what lies ahead. Croatia, here I come!

The first leg of my journey went smoothly. I traveled through dense forests and open plains, always keeping an eye out for danger. I’ve made good progress and found a nice cave to rest in for the night.

Something feels off. I noticed strange markings on the trees and heard unusual noises at night. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being followed. I need to stay alert and be cautious. My journey to Croatia might be more dangerous than I anticipated.
